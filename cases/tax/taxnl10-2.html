<!--- conditional elements (spans, divs, li's etc.)
are enabled/disabled if their contained inputs are
enabled/disabled.
For instance the span below will be display: none if newBankNr
is disabled

check: grouped logical elements in ifs, should be individual elements
(e.g. in a list, row in table etc.) or contained in the same container.
Propagation of display:none to container does not fire if there's
something in the same container that is not disabled.
